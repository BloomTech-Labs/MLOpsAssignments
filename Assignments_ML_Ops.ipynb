    "The `**context` input parameter can be any number of key, value pairs as kwarg arguments to the `render_template` function. That means we can use Python as our compute engine and HTML as our layout engine by leveraging Jinja. Jinja offers two special template markers `{{ ... }}` and `{% ... %}`. The first one allows the rendering of literal HTML. The second allows execution of Python code, albeit a limited subset of the language. It's generally better/easier to strictly use the literal HTML marker: `{{ ... }}` while you begin to learn Jinja. Anything that is printable in Python can be sent to this type of marker, so it's very powerful and easy to use.\n",
    "\n",
    "While the code marker `{% ... %}` allows us to write Python inside our HTML templates, and that sounds really cool - it's a terrible idea. You'll have no IDE code highlighting or linting or meaningful way to test, other than testing the site as a whole. Worse still, Jinja only supports a subset of the language and it's own syntax, so it's a lot like learning a whole new programming language, and it's prone to errors that are difficult to debug. Keep it simple. You can pass any Python object into Jinja and have access to all its properties and methods without too much trouble.\n",
    "\n",
    "Likewise, the HTML marker is built to take an HTML string from Python and turn it into HTML tags etc. However, it's best not to write HTML in Python! Keep your languages seperate. Just because you can, doesn't mean you should. Best practice is to do your computing in Python and only send printable output to be rendered into HTML. You can send as many components as you like, give them good names.\n"
